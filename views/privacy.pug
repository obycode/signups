            p We respect your privacy and only collect the information needed to coordinate Empower4Life programs and volunteer opportunities.
            h2 Information We Collect
            p We collect your name, email address, and optional phone number when you register for an Empower4Life account or event. If you create or manage events, we also collect the details that you voluntarily submit about those events and participants.
            h2 How We Use Your Information
            ul
              li Provide access to the Empower4Life signup portal and show you upcoming volunteer opportunities.
              li Send transactional emails through Amazon SES and secure login links so that you can access your account.
              li Send one-time passcodes by SMS through Amazon SNS when you opt in to phone-based login.
              li Share aggregate reports with Empower4Life program staff so they can plan services and confirm volunteer coverage.
            h2 Text Messaging
            p We only send SMS messages to deliver one-time passcodes for account access. Message frequency varies based on how often you request a login code. Message and data rates may apply. Reply STOP to stop SMS and HELP for help. You can still log in by email if you opt out of text messages.
            h2 Sharing and Storage
            p We do not sell or rent your personal information. We share data only with trusted service providers (Amazon SES for email, Amazon SNS for SMS, and NeonCRM for nonprofit record keeping) so they can provide services on our behalf under their own privacy and security programs.
            h2 Data Retention and Security
            p Data is stored securely in our databases and cloud infrastructure. We retain account information while your volunteer profile is active and remove information when it is no longer required for program or legal purposes.

            h2 Changes to This Policy
            p We may update this policy periodically. We will post the revised version on this page with the updated effective date.
            p Effective date: November 10, 2025
